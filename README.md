# ⭑🧑‍🎓Who are we and what's our project about?

## Welcome to the Techscape project - our goal is to support firefighters in their daily work by giving them easy access to real-time information such as team schedules, vehicle availability, equipment details, and active incident reports, so they can respond faster, stay organized, and work more efficiently in critical situations.

# ⭑💡What our Application does?
## Our application consists of a main file, headers, and functions related to each other. This structure ensures a more efficient and comprehensive approach to code implementation. Most questions require numerical answers; however, there are also open-ended questions where users must type their responses. At the end of the test, users receive a grade based on their answers. The highest grade is 6, indicating an excellent result, while the lowest grade is 2, signifying a poor outcome.
